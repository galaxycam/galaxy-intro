## Course Feedback

What could be improved for next time...?

- Get all answers to exercices ready in Galaxy
- BioMart/UCSC visualisation tutorial to check
- Improve presentation on genomics intervals
- More biological examples for the intervals without necessarily having to go over different functions - shorter exercises
- UCSC working on our CRUK-CI server
